    <p>This extension stores data locally (IndexedDB) and optionally syncs using Google Drive App Data Folder.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We access your Google account profile (email) to identify workspace membership.</li>
      <li>We use the Drive App Data Folder to store workspace snapshots; no user-visible Drive files are created in your Drive root.</li>
      <li>No third-party servers are used by default — data remains on-device and in your Drive AppData.</li>
    </ul>
